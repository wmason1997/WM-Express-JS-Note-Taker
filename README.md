The starter code was from the Develop folder that was housed in the Challenge folder within the Module 11-Express folder of the [UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC GitLab repository](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-California---San-Diego/UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC). User mvpache (Instructor Michael Pacheco) made the most recent updates to this GitLab repository.

I had a tutoring session with Mila Hose on 12/14 and Mila helped me to get the Delete functionality working after cleaning up my file organization. I had a notes.js file in the frontend that was able to be deleted because index.js contained the logic that would have been housed there.
